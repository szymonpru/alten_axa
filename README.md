### TASK

Please create a simple application with a Python back end.
The back end should offer a RESTful API endpoint which in turn communicates with a database of your choice to persists
some data received in the RESTful call. We would like to see automated tests, input sanitisation. Consider error
handling and observability. Create a local Git repository for this project.
We do not expect perfection, but would like to see confidence and good practices.
Please share the code with us (ideally using GitHub).
